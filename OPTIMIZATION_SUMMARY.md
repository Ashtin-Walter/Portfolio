# Portfolio Optimization Summary

## Bug Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Automatic Scroll to Arcade Section
**Problem**: Users were automatically taken to the arcade section when visiting the site.
**Solution**: Removed the problematic `useEffect` in `Arcade.js` that was causing automatic scrolling when category filters changed.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/sections/Arcade.js` - Removed automatic scroll behavior

### 2. Improved Page Navigation and Scroll-to-Top
**Problem**: When changing pages, users weren't starting at the top of the page.
**Solution**: Added a `ScrollToTop` component that automatically scrolls to the top on route changes.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.js` - Added ScrollToTop component and improved navigation handling

### 3. Enhanced Navbar Active Section Detection
**Problem**: Navbar active section detection was inconsistent and didn't start properly.
**Solution**: 
- Improved scroll handler with better offset calculations
- Set proper initial active section to "landing"
- Added throttling for better performance
- Fixed navigation to start at the top of sections

**Files Modified**:
- `src/sections/Navbar.js` - Enhanced scroll detection and navigation
- `src/data.js` - Added "About" to navigation menu
